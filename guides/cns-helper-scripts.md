# CNS Helper Scripts
This page will list various helper/utility scripts or tools that can be used to assist in development of CNS compatible mods. 

## Basic CNS JSON Generator
Dex (jhosuers) on Discord created a helpful batch utility script to auto generate CNS compatible JSON files. Simply download, and run the batch file to be presented with a basic interface for easily creating basic CNS compatible JSON files.
- [CNS JSON Generator](/scripts/CNS_JSON_Generator_ByDex_v1.2.bat)

Note: for the script to work correctly the path for your mod within unreal engine should be `/Content/OutfitMods/YourModNameHere/` and your skeletal mesh should be inside a folder name `Models`. eg: `/Content/OutfitMods/YourModNameHere/Models`
