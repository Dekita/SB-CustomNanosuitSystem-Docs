## Configuration Information
[CNS Mod Config Options](/guides/cns-mod-config.md) 

## Common Issues
- **OPEN CNS MENU FROM THE GAME WORLD. NOT WHILE IN MENU!!**
- **Pause Screen Freezing Game** - This occurs when you are playing in Fullscreen mode, and alt+tab out of the game. When you return to the game screen, it will have automatically paused. Simple switch from `Fullscreen` to `Borderless Window Mode`. The game will still seem fullscreen, but it will no longer pause when you alt+tab to other screens.
